# Ansible-With-AWS
Developed Ansible Playbooks in collabaration with AWS EC2 that helps in creation of an EC2 instance, Copying an AMI Taking an Snapshot, Creating an VPC, Creating a Metric alarm,Creating an S3 bucket, Adding users and deployed a static web server using EC2 instance and 
installed httpd service and deployed a static website and displayed the results of the test.

Furthermore I improved the template by taking a snapshot of the instance and creating a AMI from that template.
